                <strong>
                         Due to the effects of Hurricane Milton, this week's Follicle News was delayed to Friday.

            </p>


            <p>
                <strong>
                         During Hurricane Milton's rampage across Florida, Lord, Sir, Señor, Mr. Follicle took measures to ensure the safety of his followers. He secured and barricade all entrances so 
                         that nothing could get in or out. While this did ensure the safety of those that were in the Temple at the time, those that could not make it inside in time were 
                         left to the elements, including us. None of our crew was hurt during the incident, except the members we don't care about (they do absolutely nothing). It was 
                         actually pretty fun riding the winds to the absolute middle of nowhere. It took us 1.5 days to find civilization again. This edition of Follicle News was written 
                         and posted on a library computer. We make for the Cathedral tomorrow. 
                </strong>

                <strong>
                    Lord, Sir, Señor, Mr. Follicle has created a disaster relief fund out of donations to the Church for our followers affected by the hurricane. If you are a follower of the Follicle, 
                    a form will be sent to your doorstep that you must fill out if you want some of the disaster relief fund. The deadline for this form is October 25th, so get those 
                    forms in quick.
                </strong>

                <strong>
                    While wandering in the middle of the Everglades after the storm, we found a few followers to interview. Their current locations are unknown, as they denied to travel 
                    with us to New Orlandiami. We asked them if they believed Lord, Sir, Señor, Mr. Follicle's hurricane response was justified.
